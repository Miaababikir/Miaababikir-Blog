Before everything else I want you to remember this:

> Success is not about visibility, it's about what makes you happy.

In this article I will talk about what I have achieved in this year and what I haven't, it's been a long year a lot of things happened, so I think it's essential that I take a moment to write down some highlights of mine this year.

## 💻 Sharpening my skills

Fortunately I had almost 9 month of vacation, I waste a lot of it, I haven't done much on this year, but I spent some time working on learning new stuff and trying new technologies, here some of it:

- I learned testing and how to use **TDD** on my projects.
- I spent a lot of time learning **UI/UX** design.
- I learned how to use Adobe XD for designing UI. And now I end up using Figma. It's so cool to work with.
- I spent time working on front-end to level up my skills specially CSS.
- I managed to learn new CSS framework (Tailwind CSS) and it's **AWESOME**.
- I practiced a lot on how to write simple and readable code, I am not good at it yet but am still trying.
- I developed a lot of APIs and documentations for them this year.
- I started writing and blogging about our industry on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/miaababikir)**.

## 🕹 Open source and side projects

I am really enjoy working on open source project and also working on side projects that a lot of them have never see the light (I mean **A lot**) but in this year I managed to finish some of them.

- **[JoeVue](https://github.com/Miaababikir/JoeVue)** it's a tool that help Vue js developer on their workflow.
- **[Snow](https://github.com/Miaababikir/Snow)** it's a Laravel package that convert JSON to HTML elements.
- **[Nothing works](http://nothing-works.herokuapp.com/)** headless CMS it's not finished yet, I don't know if I am going back to it or not.
- **[Nullable](https://nothing-works.netlify.com/)** it's an open source portfolio for developers built with tailwind and vue.
- **[Meraki UI](https://twitter.com/miaababikir/status/1197976205003313153)** it's RTL UI component built with tailwind css, still WOP but we have big plans for this project I really enjoy working on it.

## ✏️ Writing

This year I start writing about some interesting things about our industry. Writing and sharing knowledge is quite fun. I published not that many articles but the feedback I got is quite positive. I definitely want to continue writing.

When I started blogging I also became more active on social networks like Twitter, I get to know new inspiring people and get to join awesome developers communities, actually I don’t know why I didn’t do it earlier…  

## 📖 Reading

In the last years I struggled to start reading books. Every time I make a goal to start reading a number of books but I never did. This year I started a habit on reading specific number of pages every day and I started to finish some books. Here some of my best reads in this year:

**Non Technical books:**

- **Steel like an artist** by Austin Kleon.
- **Islamic Declaration** by Ali Izetbegovic.
- **Animal farm** by George Orwell.
- **Eat Pray Love** by Elizabeth Gilbert

**Technical Books:**

- **Clean Architecture** by Uncle Bob.
- **Clean Code** By Uncle Bob.
- **Refactoring UI** by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger. (I am not read all of it, but I always come back for it).

## 📈 Self development and productivity

In this year I had a lot of burnout and depressing moments that stick with me for months. For months I never accomplished anything. I am not trying to stop these burnout gabs but I have to make it not taking a lot of time from me.

Some of the things that helped me along the way is committing to the GYM and taking some time off (Not long time) from projects and learning and just doing anything that not related.

I tried to start new habits and stopping bad ones, I haven't done much also but I am still trying. I am really want to start getting up early and getting things done and stop procrastinating am really struggling with that. I am not always stick to my daily routine. Some days I am very productive others am not doing anything.

## 💉 Health

In this year I started a diet and kinda committed to go to the GYM. I lost almost 20 kilos in 8 month. And I gained a lot of strength from going to the GYM. I feel much better now but I returned to my old eating habits not as bad as it was but still.

I am still going to the GYM but I need to return to my diet. I still need to lose more weight this year too. And maintaining my gained strength. 

## 💔 What didn't go right

There is a lot of stuff I really wanted to achieve them this year but I didn't here are some of them:

- Talking on meetup or conference.
- Teaching a course.
- Finishing and deploying my blog.
- Redesigning my portfolio.
- Completing the Headless CMS project.

## 🎉 What about 2020?

Honestly, I really don't know but here some thing I want to accomplish this year plus the things I didn't get to achieve last year:

- First of all **Graduating**.
- Losing weight and developing my strength.
- Finishing Meraki UI project.
- Reading as many books as I can.
- Release more side projects.
- Writing more articles.
- Improving my English specially in writing.

## Closing notes

I am sorry for this long article. I guess if I forgot anything else because it's not that important. 

At last i will leave you with this. As a wise man once said:

> Make a plan, execute the plan, expect the plan to go off the rails, throw away the plan.

See ya!
