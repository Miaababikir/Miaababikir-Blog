In this article I will talk about my setup and what apps and tools I am using. So here a list of all the things I use daily.

## IDE

I am using **PhoStorm** as my main editor. It's really enjoy working on it. It never felt like using **Sublime**. I wish if it had the speed and the smoothness that **Sublime** had. Here screen shot of my editor.

For the theme I am using **Martial Theme UI** and using **Atom One Dark** and for the font I am using **Fira Code** font. 

Like you see on the screenshot I like to keep it minimal no navigation bar or tool bar or any other UI things that I never use.

## Terminal

I am using Konsole KDE editor. Here is screenshot.

## OS

I am using **Ubuntu 19**. I am enjoying working on it. I guess it's not as awesome as **MacOS**. But it works fine for me. I am also installing **Windows** beside my Ubuntu. The only reason that I kept my **Windows** because I am playing games on it. Here is screenshot for my Ubuntu.

I am using Ubuntu KDE Plasma desktop and I customized it to kinda look like MacOS. Here a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBCBqEC6sS8&t) if you want your desktop to look like mine.

## Machine

I am using **[Dell Inspiron 17 7577](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-Inspiron-15-7000-7577-i7-7700HQ-GTX-1060-Max-Q-4K-UHD-Laptop-Review.282650.0.html)** I am having it for two almost three years now. It work fine for me. The one thing that i struggle with that it is very heavy for my back. But beside that it's really good am not thinking to upgrading to new one soon.

## Applications and tools

Here are some other applications I use a lot:

- For database I am using **Mysql Workbench** and some times Beaver.
- My go to browser is **Chromium**.
- I am writing my articles with **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)**. I am also using it to take notes and manage some of my projects. It's an awesome tool you can do a lot with it.
- For video recording I am using **Peek**. Just using it to record videos to some of my projects.
- For designing I am using **Figma**. I can't say enough about this tool.

For my phone I am using these:

- **Google Keep** for taking notes.
- **Castbox** it's a great podcast client also I am using SoundCloud.
- **Daily Strength** to record my progress on the GYM (Logging your sets and reps, weights).
- **Slack** for communicating with teams.
- **Discord** communication with dev communities.
- **Todoist** to set reminder and small to-dos for the day.

## In closing

I hope you enjoyed this little overview of the stuff Iâ€™m using. I plan on writing a article like this every year.
