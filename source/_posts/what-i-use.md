In this article I will talk about my setup and what apps and tools I am using. So here a list of all the things I use daily.

## IDE

I am using **PhpStorm** as my main editor. I enjoy using it. I wish if it had the speed and the smoothness that **Sublime** had. Here screenshot of my editor.

For the theme I am using **Martial Theme UI** and **Atom One Dark** and for the font I am using **Fira Code** font. 

Like you see on the screenshot I like to keep it minimal no navigation bar or tool bar or any other UI things that I never use.

## Terminal

I am using Konsole KDE editor. Here is screenshot.

## OS

I am using **Ubuntu 19**. I am enjoying working on it. I guess it's not as awesome as **MacOS**. But it works fine for me. I am also installing **Windows** beside my Ubuntu. I am not using it that much. I guess just for playing **video games**. Here is a screenshot for my Ubuntu.

I am using **Ubuntu KDE Plasma** desktop and I customized it to kinda look like macOS. Here a [**tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBCBqEC6sS8&t) if you want your desktop to look like mine.

There is a lot of nice features in KDE desktop. And it is very customizable and you can change every UI component of it. The only trade-off that it needs a good laptop to work on smoothly.

## Machine

I am using **[Dell Inspiron 17 7577](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-Inspiron-15-7000-7577-i7-7700HQ-GTX-1060-Max-Q-4K-UHD-Laptop-Review.282650.0.html)** I am having it for two almost three years now. It works fine for me. The one thing that I struggle with that it is very heavy for my back. But besides that, it's really good am not thinking about upgrading to a new one soon.

## Applications and tools

Here are some other applications I use a lot:

- For database I am using **[Mysql Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)** and some times **Beaver**.
- My go to browser is **[Chromium](https://itsfoss.com/install-chromium-ubuntu/)**.
- I am writing my articles with **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)**. I am also using it to take notes and manage some of my projects. It's an awesome tool you can do a lot with it.
- For video recording I am using **[Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek)**. Just using it to record videos to some of my projects.
- For designing I am using **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**. I can't say enough about this tool.
- For code snippets screenshots **[Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/).**
- **[Polacode](https://github.com/octref/polacode)** you can also use this cool plugin for VS Code to take screenshots for your code snippets.
- For the emojis on my articles I am using **[Get Emoji](https://getemoji.com/)**.

For my phone I am using these:

- **[Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)** for taking notes.
- **[Castbox](https://castbox.fm/)** it's a great podcast client also I am using SoundCloud.
- **[Daily Strength](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anthonyng.workoutapp&hl=en_US)** to record my progress on the GYM (Logging your sets and reps, weights).
- **[Slack](https://slack.com/)** for communicating with teams.
- **[Discord](https://discordapp.com/)** communication with dev communities.
- **[Todoist](https://todoist.com/)** to set reminder and small to-dos for the day.

I will keep adding more every while. 

## In closing

I hope you enjoyed this little overview of the stuff Iâ€™m using. I plan on writing an article like this every year.
